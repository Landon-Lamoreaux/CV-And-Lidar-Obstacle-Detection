# Obstacle Image
This node reads in the transformed camera point clouds and the Lidar scan and combines them into a single point cloud. Then publishs that point cloud as a list of all the obstacles around the robot.

You will need to install the pcl library to get everything to work:

## pcl
`sudo apt install ros-humble-pcl-ros`
